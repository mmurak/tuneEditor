<p>[*1] Due to the current status of JavaScript standards, the behaviour of the cut/copy & paste function (especially paste function) varies from browser to browser.  For this reason, this application currently employs internal clipboard, which means the application can't interact with other applications.</p>

<p>[*2] In this web app, when you click on a Tone-button-matrix (one of the buttons that specifies the height and stress of a tone), the focus automatically moves to the next tone.  This means that if you accidentally click an inappropriate button, you will have to re-select the previous tone every time.  I know that the best way to solve this problem is to implement the Undo function, but I'm still working on the specifications (^^;), so I decided to implement a "pseudo-Undo" which makes focus move 1 position to the left by pressing Ctrl+Z.</p>

<p>[*3] This feature was implemented at the suggestions of Prof. Yoshiki Nagase.  I would like to thank Prof. Nagase, and Mr. Takeo Kubo for passing on the suggestions.</p>
